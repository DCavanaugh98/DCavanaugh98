### Hi, my name is David Cavanaugh

I am a Data Scientist at Werner Enterprises. I am interested in all things data related; exploring, analyzing, and modelling. My favorite projects are the ones where I get to develop some new code to assist me in providing a flexible and valuable solution which meets and exceeds the original project goals.
